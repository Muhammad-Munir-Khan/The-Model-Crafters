This project is a web-based platform for training and evaluating machine learning models. Users can upload CSV datasets, select from multiple classification algorithms (SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors), and train models. After training, the platform provides performance metrics like confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, ROC curve, and AUC. Built using Flask, it allows seamless integration of machine learning tasks in a user-friendly interface, making it ideal for users who want to experiment with different models and evaluate their performance.
